Man made his first landing on Mars. American astronaut Mark Wattney (Matt Damon) and five other astronauts suffered huge storms. His journey to outer space could only be completed ahead of time. He was left on Mars because he was mistaken for being unable to survive and became a space Robinson. Wattney wakes up and finds himself far away from Earth's home, where food is available for only a month. Fortunately, because of his humorous and optimistic nature and botanical expertise, he decided to survive on his own until the next Mars mission, although it would take four years. Watney worked out how to make the best use of his time on the arid planet and began to grow potatoes with homemade fertilizers to make the best use of all the materials at hand. On Earth, after the public mourned Mark's tragic death, a sharp-eyed NASA technician watched and noticed signs of movement on the surface of Mars, suspecting that Mark might still be alive. After the two sides re-contacted, the Mars rescue mission was launched.
